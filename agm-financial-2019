\section*{Income}
Membership and sponsorship each supplied over 40\% of the club's income. A small number of personal donations were made by members in lieu of borrowing the club's gazebo. Income related to socials and kit was entirely due to payments from members after the club paid for items in bulk.

Following discussion at the previous AGM the committee decided that the club should aim to retain \pounds1k in reserve. The club's bank balance at the end of January was \textbf{\pounds1,393.89} although some of this is already allocated to further necessary costs related to the Bellfield move (details below). 

\section*{Plans for 2019} 	
Both boats will be stored at Bellfield where we will benefit from lower rental costs in general, with a large discount during the first year by agreement with ActionPorty to offset the costs of widening the gate. We will retain the Bellfield Lane shed for a short time to allow the bosuns group to tackle some maintenance work which needs to be done under cover.  

Income from membership in 2019 is estimated to be around \pounds4.4k. For the first time since the club opened, the full adult membership fee was increased this year by \pounds5 to \pounds90 to support us through the one-off costs involved in converting to a two-boat club in new premises. Fees for adult concessions (\pounds65) and youth members (\pounds20 or \pounds40) stayed the same. Fees are subject to an annual review and may be reduced again in future if costs are comfortably covered this year.  

Expected costs for 2019 (\pounds4.3k) should be covered by membership fees. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Final Bellfield costs (e.g. storage unit, cover supports) - \pounds700
	\item Bellfield rental - \pounds50 per month 
	\item Additional rental costs - \pounds1k
	\item Skelf \& Sprite equipment upgrade, repair or replacement \pounds750
	\item Insurance - \pounds620
	\item Admin \& affiliation - \pounds110
	\item Training support - \pounds350
	\item Regatta towing - \pounds200
\end{itemize} 
\medskip

Other sources of sponsorship will be sought as necessary for specific costs or initiatives. We aim to hold \pounds1k in reserve at the end of January 2020.
